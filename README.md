## Installation

[`Try HACS first`](https://hacs.xyz/)

1. Download the `banner-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/nervetattoo/banner-card/releases/latest) and store it in your `configuration/www` folder.
   _Previously you could download the source file from Github but starting from the 0.14 release that is no longer possible. If you try to do so it will crash_
2. Configure Lovelace to load the card:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/banner-card.js?v=1
    type: module
```

## Available configuration options:

### heading

Previously headings only allowed strings and icons were a hack using unicode emojis.
**From 0.10.0** you can however render icons from the mdi/hass icon sets:

```yaml
type: custom:banner-card
heading:
  - mdi:shower
  - Bathroom
```

Using the alternate YAML form for arrays might be more/less readable depending on your preference:

```yaml
type: custom:banner-card
heading: [mdi:shower, Bathroom]
```

You can combine as many texts and icons as you like this way.

```yaml
type: custom:banner-card
heading: [mdi:shower, Bathroom, mdi:paper-roll]
```

### map_state

You can use `map_state` to force a value or icon to be rendered when the entity has a certain state. It either supports a full object where you can override any key for the entity, like `value`, `name`, `unit` and so on, or a shorthand string that maps to `value`.
Both forms in an example:

```yaml
entity: media_player.office
map_state:
  playing: mdi:disc-player
  not_playing:
    value: mdi:stop
    name: A custom entity heading
```

## Using when

You can filter entities with a simple but powerful `when` object. This allows you to filter based on state and/or attributes. It is probably simpliest explained through a few examples

This limits to only showing a media_player entity when it is playing. It uses the shorthand form for `when` where a simple string is used instead of specifying an object with state key.

```yaml
entity: media_player.office
when: playing
```

This example limits to only showing a light entity when its on and above a certain brightness

```yaml
entity: light.my_light
when:
  state: "on"
  attributes:
    brightness: [">", 50]
```

The last example shows how passing a simple string/number will imply an equality operator check, whereas you can configure using an array to using different operators. The following operators exist:

### When operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `=`      | **Equal** check to either match a string/number/boolean input, or if given an array, check that the real value exists inside said array. This is the default operator used when a simple value is set | `state: ['=', 'on', 'off']`              |
| !=       | **Not equal** check that is exactly like the equal check, just negated (opposite results)                                                                                                             | `fan_mode: ['!=', 'On Low', 'Auto Low']` |
| >        | **Bigger than** checks if real value is bigger than what is set. Does not support multiple values                                                                                                     | `brightness: ['>', 50]`                  |
| <        | **Smaller than** checks if real value is smaller than what is set. Does not support multiple values                                                                                                   | `brightness: ['<', 50]`                  |

## Using entity action

You can add **simple** buttons by specifying the action property for an entity. This is intended for simple use cases to start scripts or set a light to specific brightness for example. You can enforce a fixed icon using a crazy hack (and there I made it a feature) that sets an entities value via config. (Its normaly read from state). You can also use `map_state` to use different icons for different states.

```yaml
entity: light.my_light
name: Reading light
value: mdi:book-open-page-variant
action:
  service: light.turn_on
  brightness: 50
```

## CSS vars for theming

Please see the [official docs on theming](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/frontend/#defining-themes) or [check out a tutorial like this one](https://www.juanmtech.com/themes-in-home-assistant/)
The card uses the following CSS variables:

| Var name                          | Default value             | Usage                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --banner-card-error-color         | var(--lumo-error-color)   | Background color when there's an error crashing the card                      |
| --banner-card-heading-size        | 3em                       | The main heading of the card                                                  |
| --banner-card-entity-value-size   | 1.5em                     | Entity value font size                                                        |
| --banner-card-media-title-size    | 0.9em                     | Media player fonts title font size                                            |

| --banner-card-spacing             | 4px                       | Base unit for spacing. Used in multiples many places                          |
| --banner-card-heading-color-dark  | var(--primary-text-color) | The card measures your bg color to figure out to use dark or light text color |

## Examples

_Using map_state to render a switch as a colored icon_

```yaml
- entity: switch.switch
  name: Is it on?
  domain: sensor
  value: mdi:star
  color: black
  map_state:
    "on":
      color: yellow
```

_Use a background image instead of a color_

```yaml
type: custom:banner-card
background: 'url("https://source.unsplash.com/random/500x300")'
heading: Image bacground
```

_Basic examples_

```yaml
type: custom:banner-card
background: "#EDE7B0"
heading: "\U0001F6CB Living room"
link: /lovelace/living_room
entities:
  - light.fibaro_system_fgd212_dimmer_2_level
  - light.fibaro_system_fgd212_dimmer_2_level_3
  - sensor.aeotec_zw100_multisensor_6_temperature_6
  - entity: sensor.aeotec_zw100_multisensor_6_luminance_6
    name: Lux
  - entity: cover.fibaro_system_fgrm222_roller_shutter_controller_2_level
    name: Roller shutter
```

```yaml
type: custom:banner-card
heading:
  - mdi:shower
  - Bathroom
background: "#B0C2ED"
link: /lovelace/bathroom
entities:
  - entity: light.fibaro_system_fgd212_dimmer_2_level_11
    name: Light
  - entity: sensor.aeotec_zw100_multisensor_6_temperature_5
    name: Temperature
  - entity: sensor.aeotec_zw100_multisensor_6_relative_humidity_5
    name: Humidity
```
